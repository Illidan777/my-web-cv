                <p class="about__text">
                    As a  back-end Java developer with 4 years of experience, I specialize in designing and implementing
                    Java-based systems, with a deep understanding of frameworks such as Spring (Boot, Data, Security) and
                    expertise in database technologies, including SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (Redis).
                    I am also proficient in message brokers like Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ, and experienced in software
                    development and testing (JUnit, Mockito). I prioritize writing clean, maintainable, and flexible code.
                    Throughout my career, I have been involved in the full software development lifecycle from analyzing
                    business requirements and designing system architecture to hands-on implementation.
                    Over the past year, I have expanded my skill set into data science and machine learning,
                    successfully completing a range of personal projects in these areas. I have also ventured
                    into front-end development, moving towards full-stack engineering capabilities.
                    My main expertise is Java, with a focus on delivering high-performance, scalable
                    software solutions that address real business challenges. I am known for being proactive, dedicated,
                    and detail-oriented, with a strong sense of responsibility and leadership. With a systematic approach
                    and a positive attitude, I am committed to continuous growth and delivering impactful results.
